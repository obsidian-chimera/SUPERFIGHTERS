# SUPERFIGHTERS GAME
## AIM
This project aims at highlighting my coding skills and proficiency at using Github and Git version control to develop my OCR A Level Computer Science NEA Project.

## What is it?
Superfighters is a retro arcade game that is a 2D fighter with bots and perhaps 2 player?

## Current Stage of Progress
### ***STARTED BUT ALREADY KINDA LOST***
I have not made much progress yet since I've spent a lot of time researching how exactly pygame works and what I need to do to properly make use of it.
I also need to consult my teacher on how exactly we are supposed to reference since everything is essentially going to the reuse of code on some level since the skeleton upon which this game will work is the same for every single other platformer in existence made via python. 

## What have I learnt?
  - Separating out modules and importing into a main file makes everything look so much better and it's so much more readable!
  - Using a separate class file for all of my classes is perfect
  - Pygame is rather rudimentary for maze creation so I found a tool called Tiled Map Editor and a library called pytmx that would enable the game to be much better but I don't know if that leads to dropped marks since it is not my own code or algorithm then
    - Currently avoiding using this without consulting my teacher
